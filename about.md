Hello!  


My name is LeAnn Woo. I graduated from UCLA in 2017 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science, specialization in Computer Science, and minor in Statistics. I'm hoping to pursue a masters in Applied Statistics, but for now I'm working [Dr. Michael Alfaro](https://michaelalfaro.github.io//alfaro-lab/){: style="color: red"} at UCLA to implement machine learning concepts in fish databases. Yep, you read that correctly.

To feed myself my standard 7 meals a day (joking), I work full-time as a data analyst at [System1](http://www.system1.com/){: style="color: red"}.

I have a lot of wanderlust and am always dreaming of new adventures to go on. Since traveling isn't always feasible, I make do and satisfy my need to move by hiking with my best bud, Frodo. He's a real cutie.


If you have any questions about what I've worked on in the past or what I had for dinner, feel free to [email me](mailto:leannkwoo@gmail.com?Subject=Hello!){: style="color: red"}! Alternatively, feel free to browse my [resume]({{"images/LW Resume 2018.pdf"|absolute_url}}){: style="color: red"} for past experiences.
