Hello!  


My name is LeAnn Woo. I graduated from UCLA in 2017 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science, specialization in Computer Science, and minor in Statistics. Currently, I'm a data analyst at [System1](http://www.system1.com/){: style="color: red"} and am working towards strengthening my technical and analytical skills.

I have a lot of wanderlust and am always dreaming of new adventures to go on. Since traveling isn't always feasible, I make do and satisfy my need to move by hiking with my best bud, Frodo.


If you have any questions about what I've worked on in the past or what I had for dinner, feel free to [email me](mailto:leannkwoo@gmail.com?Subject=Hello!){: style="color: red"}! Alternatively, feel free to browse my [resume]({{"images/LW Resume 2018.pdf"|absolute_url}}){: style="color: red"} for past experiences.
